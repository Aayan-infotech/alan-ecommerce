Both are durable and energy efficient and can be used exclusively, but Siliconized Acrylic is recommended for interior caulking, and Polyurethane is recommended for exterior caulking. This is mainly because Polyurethane is toxic.",
    "recommendation": "If you are doing a window installation, we recommend you purchase 1 tube of Polyurethane Caulk, and 1 tube of Siliconized Acrylic Caulk. Use the Polyurethane on the outside of the window, and the Siliconized Acrylic on the inside of the window. You may also need some Expanding Foam Sealant, and Vinyl Trim Strips to fill in and cover up any gaps. This is explained in the Do-It-Yourself article about how to apply caulk.",

It is the best choice for interior caulking, but can also be used on exterior caulking.",

          "The downside to this type of caulk is that it is somewhat messy to work with, as it is stringy and sticks to your hands and clothes. It must be cleaned up with mineral spirits, as it is not water soluble. It can also be somewhat toxic, so it should not be applied around intake ducts or ventilation grilles, where siliconized acrylic latex caulk should be used.",

      "text": "An average home may lose up to 30% of its heat or air-conditioning energy through in-efficient doors and windows. This can be due to a lot of reasons, but mostly because of out-dated technology, poorly sealed doors, and single pane windows. Most homeowners are well aware of this after walking into a room with old windows, and feeling the unsettling winter chill. Over the years there have been monumental improvements in door and window energy efficiency technology."

      "text": "Here at Discount Door and Window, we have selected products that we have found to be very energy efficient, durable and low cost. All of our windows qualify for a Tax Rebate if you use them to replace old aluminum or wood windows. This is because the amount of energy you save is large enough that the government wants to encourage homeowners to make the upgrade. With this tax rebate, and monthly savings on the energy bill, our retrofit vinyl windows will pay for themselves within a few years."

    "energy_efficient_technology": {
      "text": "There are a lot of qualities that attribute to how efficient our doors and windows are, but the most distinguishing features are the double pane with argon gas and Low-E technology. Low-E is short for 'low-emissivity.' It is a high-tech coating on the glass that is designed to block much of the heat and ultra-violet light from the sun, while permitting a large percentage of visible light. Argon-filled double pane glass provides excellent insulation. These technology help keep the warmth in during the winter, and the heat out the summer."

    "measuring_efficiency": {
      "text": "When purchasing new windows or doors, there are two key measure of efficiency that should be considered. The U-value of a window or door is a measure of heat loss. And the “Solar Heat Gain Coefficient” (SHGC) which measures how well a product blocks heat from the sun. For both of these measurements: the lower the number the higher the efficiency. These numbers are calculated by the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC). Our windows at Discount Door and Window have a U-Value of atleast 0.3"

This involves cutting back the stucco or siding four to eight inches from the edge of your window, removing the flashing paper and then removing the old window. Next your contractor will install the new window, apply new flashing paper, and then replace the stucco, usually a three-step process. The advantage to using new construction windows is that your new windows will be the same size as your old windows. The disadvantage is that if you are not planning to re-stucco your house, you will eventually be able to tell that the stucco was patched. The old stucco and the new stucco will not expand and contract at the same rate and over time cracks will appear between the old and new stucco. This installation method also costs considerably more than using the “retro-fit” installation method."

            "description": "If you are not planning to re-stucco your house any time soon or if you are concerned about your budget, a retro-fit window is probably your best choice. Installing retro-fit windows does not require any stucco damage because the perimeter frame of the old window will not be removed. The new retro-fit window is designed to fit inside your old window. Your contractor will use a different installation method, and a different type of retro-fit window, depending on whether your old windows are metal or wood. Because your new window is fitting inside the frame of your old window, it will need to be slightly smaller than the old window was. In most cases this is barely noticeable, but if the old window was small in the first place, such as a bathroom window, it may seem obvious. Also, some window companies have a very wide exterior flange that some homeowners find unattractive."

The new window will come with a flange that extends about two inches all around the perimeter of the frame. The new window will fit inside the opening of your old window and the flange will conceal the perimeter frame of your old window.

The contractor will remove either the interior or the exterior stops of the old windows, remove the sash (moving parts that hold the glass) and leave the perimeter frame in place. The new window will fit into the old perimeter frame. Some companies offer an aluminum wrap for the old wood window sill, but be sure to ask to see some jobs where this has been done. It is difficult to do well, and the wrap often has gaps where the edges do not line up well. In most cases, a good paint job will finish off the old window sill nicely and painting will help keep the charm of the old wood windows.(See How We Install from the main Menu of our web site) www.LaMesaDoorWindow.com."

With single-glazed windows, there is very little that can go wrong with the glass unless it breaks, but single glazed windows do almost nothing to insulate your home. The advantage to dual-glazed windows is that the air trapped between the panes of glass insulates the way air trapped between feathers in a down comforter insulates. The disadvantage to dual-glazed windows is that the hermetic seal will fail eventually, most experts say in 15 to 20 years, so it is important to choose a window manufacturer who offers a warranty on the dual-glazed units, and who is likely to still be in business 15 to 20 years from now. If not covered by warranty, replacing the dual-glazed units will probably cost as much as your replacement windows did in the first place"
