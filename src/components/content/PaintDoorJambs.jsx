              Tips: <br />
              It is not required to remove the door to paint a door jamb. Swing
              the door in and out to as needed during the application process.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
              Do not use an acrylic latex paint to coat a stained door jamb, or
              finish will peel.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
              Do not paint directly over a raw wood door jam, or the paint will
              eventually flake.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
              To paint a door jamb which is already been painted,  apply a coat
              of acrylic latex paint with a 2- to 3-inch latex paintbrush.
