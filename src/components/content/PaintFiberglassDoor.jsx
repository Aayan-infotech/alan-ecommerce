            1. Lay door horizontally on saw horses or a table.
            <br />
            2. Remove all the hardware and mask off anything you don't want
            painted, such as the glass insert.
            <br />
            3. Do not sand grained Fiberglass.
            <br />
            4. Wipe the door with acetone to clean any dust or residue from the
            surface.
            <br />
            5. Allow acetone to dry from the surface before applying paint. Do
            not use hydro-carbon based solvents to clean the surface as such
            products may leave a residue.
            <br />
            6. Apply primer with a 4" brush beginning with the panels. Follow
            the manufacturer's instructions for drying time before applying
            topcoat.
            <br />
            7. The primer must be completely dry before applying any finish
            topcoat.

            1. Apply exterior grade paint with 4" brush in the direction of the
            grain.
            <br />
            2. It is common practice to paint both stiles the same color as the
            exterior side of the door. If applying a second coat, follow the
            manufacturer's instructions for drying time between coats.
